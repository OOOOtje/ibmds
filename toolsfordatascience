Arithmetic expressions are used to perform mathematical calculations. In markdown, you can present these expressions using LaTeX syntax within double dollar signs for display mode. Here are a few examples:

- Addition: a+b
- Subtraction: a−b
- Multiplication: a×b or a⋅b
- Division: ba​ or a÷b
- Exponentiation: ab
- Square root: a​

# Define the numbers
number1 = 5
number2 = 10
number3 = 3

# Multiply and add the numbers
result = (number1 * number2) + number3

# Print the result
print("The result of multiplying", number1, "and", number2, "then adding", number3, "is:", result)

# Define the number of minutes
minutes = 120

# Convert minutes to hours
hours = minutes / 60

# Print the result
print(minutes, "minutes is equal to", hours, "hours.")
